# Snake-Game
My First JS Game

#I have Created one html for game-board area and one div elemet.

#Added css to style the background as well as snake and food.

#Then comes the important thing with JS.
#Created one game.js for main function and other important function to invoke.
#Using module type to easily import and export different js files.
#For snake body and movement of the structure , one seperate JS file with snake.js file name.
#Abd for food created food.js for random generation of food, except the snake body area.
#grid.js file for creating the snake and food position.
#input.js file for handling the movement of snake with keyboard.

#Learned and practiced so many things of JS module type , different function invoking methods.

#Thanks for watching
